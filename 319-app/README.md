## SBA 319 Requirements
 - Use at least three different data collections within the database (such as users, posts, or comments).
 - Utilize reasonable data modeling practices.
 - Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client, using appropriate query commands to retrieve the data from the database.
 - Create POST routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate insertion commands to add data to the database. At least one data collection should allow for client creation via a POST request.
 - Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate update commands to change data in the database. At least one data collection should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.
 - Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate delete commands to remove data from the database. At least one data collection should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.
 - Include sensible indexes for any and all fields that are queried frequently. For fields that may have a high write-to-read ratio, you may forgo indexes for performance considerations. Make comments of this where applicable.
 - Include sensible MongoDB data validation rules for at least one data collection.
 - Populate your application's collections with sample data illustrating the use case of the collections. You must include at least five sample documents per collection.
 - Utilize reasonable code organization practices.
 - Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
 - Commit frequently to the git repository.
 - Include a README file that contains a description of your application. This README must include a description of your API's available routes and their corresponding CRUD operations for reference.
 - Level of effort displayed in creativity and user experience.
 - Level of effort displayed in creativity and user experience.
